        <h1>Privacy Policy for The The Antidote</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> September 3, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how The Antidote handles your information. Your privacy is critically important to us, and our policy is simple:</p>

        <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
        <p>The Antidote does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or data about your device usage. All screen time data, selected apps, and settings are processed and stored exclusively on your device within the secure environment provided by Apple's frameworks.</p>

        <h2>2. On-Device Processing</h2>
        <p>The core functionality of The Antidote, including monitoring app usage and enforcing time limits, is performed entirely on your device. We do not have access to your activity, and no data is ever sent to us or any third party.</p>

        <h2>3. FamilyControls Framework</h2>
        <p>The Antidote uses Apple's FamilyControls framework to provide its features. Your selections within the `FamilyActivityPicker` are kept private from the app itself, in accordance with Apple's privacy-preserving design.</p>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected in the updated version of the app and on this page.</p>

        <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@theantidoteapp.com">hello@theantidoteapp.com</a>.</p>
